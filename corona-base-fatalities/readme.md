# Base Fatalities Estimation

Using binomial distribution to estimate fatalities given # of cases.  

## Use-case

Two calculations are offered: 

### Base Fatalities

Given a base probability (e.g. JHU total), what is the likelihood that deaths are equal to or higher than the amount reported. 

### Likely Deaths

Given a base probability (e.g. JHU total), what is the likely number of deaths at various case level and probability. 

### Estimation

Given a base probability (e.g. JHU total), what case level justifies the current level of mortality in an area.

## Caveat
